      "Ideally, three non-colinear markers placed on a moving rigid body is everything we need to describe its movement (translation and rotation) in relation to a fixed coordinate system. However, in pratical situations of human motion analysis, markers are placed on the soft tissue of a deformable body and this generates artifacts caused by muscle contraction, skin deformation, marker wobbling, etc. In this situation, the use of only three markers can produce unreliable results. It has been shown that four or more markers on the segment followed by a mathematical procedure to calculate the 'best' rigid-body transformation taking into account all these markers produces more robust results (S\u00f6derkvist & Wedin 1993; Challis 1995; Cappozzo et al. 1997).  \n",

      "One mathematical procedure to calculate the transformation with three or more marker positions envolves the use of the [singular value decomposition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition) (SVD) algorithm from linear algebra. The SVD algorithm decomposes a matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ (which represents a general transformation between two coordinate systems) into three simple transformations: a rotation $\\mathbf{V^T}$, a scaling factor $\\mathbf{S}$ along the rotated axes and a second rotation $\\mathbf{U}$: \n",

      "For example, if we have registered the position of four markers placed on a moving segment in 100 different instants and the position of these same markers during, what is known in Biomechanics, a static calibration trial, we would use the SVD algorithm to calculate the 100 rotation matrices (between the static trials and the 100 instants) in order to find the Cardan angles for each instant.   \n",
