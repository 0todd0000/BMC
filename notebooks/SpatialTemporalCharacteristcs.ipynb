      "The measurement of spatial and temporal characteristcs of a movement pattern is an important resource for the characterization of the observed movement. Such variables are typically the first description performed in gait analysis (Whittle, 2007) and also used in the study of other movements and biological systems. The determination of such variables is also an excellent and valuable example of the application of relatively simple concepts of kinematics.\n",

      "Gait is the pattern of movement with the limbs by animals during terrestrial locomotion and for humans, gait consists of walking or running. Gait is typically a repetitive task where the overall pattern of movement repeats after a certain period or cycle. In the context of human gait, the movement of interest, walking or running, can be defined by steps or strides performed with the limbs. A step is the movement of one foot in front of the other and a stride is two consecutive steps with alternation of the limbs, as illustrated next.  \n",

      "- Step length: distance in the direction of progression between two consecutive similar events with the different limbs. For instance, the distance between two heel strikes, with the right and left limbs.   \n",
      "- Stride length: distance in the direction of progression between two consecutive similar events with the same limb. For instance, the distance between two heel strikes with the right limb.   \n",
      "- Step duration: time duration of the step.   \n",
      "- Stride duration: time duration of the stride.     \n",
      "- Cadence: number of steps per unit of time.   \n",
      "- Velocity: travelled distance divided by the spent time.    \n",

      "- Duty factor: period of contact of one limb with the ground divided by the stride period.\n",
