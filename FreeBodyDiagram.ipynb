      "In the mechanical modelling of an inanimate or living system, composed by one or more bodies (bodies as units that are mechanically isolated according to the question one is trying to answer), it is convenient to isolate each body (be they originally interconnected or not) and identify each force and moment of force that act on this body in order to apply the laws of mechanics.\n",

      "**The free body diagram (FBD) of a mechanical system or model is the representation in a diagram of all forces and moments of force acting on each body, isolated from the rest of the system.**  \n",
      "\n",
      "The term free means that each body, which maybe was part of a connected system, is represented as isolated (free) and any existent contact force is represented in the diagram as forces (action and reaction) acting on the formely connected bodies. Then, the laws of mechanics are applied on each body, and the unknown movement, force or moment of force can be found if the system of equations is determined (the number of unknown variables can not be greater than the number of equations for each body).\n",
      "\n",
      "How exactly a FBD is drawn for a mechanical model of something is dependent on what one is trying to find. For example, the air resistance might be neglected or not when modelling the movement of an object and the number of parts the system is divided is dependent on what is needed to know about the model.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The use of FBD is very common in biomechanics; a typical use is to use the FBD in order to determine the forces and torques on the ankle, knee, and hip joints of the lower limb (foot, leg, and thigh) during locomotion, but in fact the FBD can be applied to any problem where the laws of mechanics are needed to solve a problem.  \n",
      "Let's start using the FBD to solve simple problems in mechanics and evolve to perform a biomechanical analysis of locomotion.\n",
